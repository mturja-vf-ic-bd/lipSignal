# lipSignal
lipSignal is an attempt to convert lip movement into signals. Converting lip movement to signals can help us automatically generate voice only from lip movement. This task is challenging due to the fact that similar lip movement pattern can create multiple sounds as there are more phonemes than visemes. But we can leverage context information to resolve ambiguities. This project is the first step towards this goal.
